<!--
    HTML structured like a tree
#basic unit called elements, denoted by open & closing tags that may have content in between
#<type> content </type>
#content can be more html elements, nested inside eachother
-->

<!--
    <div> stands for divider, basically a container to organize content </div>
-->

<!--
    tags can take attributes (basically like you providing them a fxn arg)
-->

<!--
    class is an attribute that sets style
-->

<!--
    CSS lets you select an element to style (by type: all elements of given tag ex headers)
(by element class: subset of all tags & probably can apply across tags too, many-many relationship)
(by element id: these must be unique, will only edit 1 element bc 1-1 relationship)

SELECTOR {
    attribute:value;
    ...
}
